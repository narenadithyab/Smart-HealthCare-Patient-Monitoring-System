# Smart-HealthCare-Patient-Monitoring-System


A details desciption of the project in Report

The Healthcare industry remains among the fastest to adopt the Internet of Things. The reason for this trend is that integrating IoT features into medical devices greatly improves the quality and effectiveness of service, bringing especially high value for the elderly, patients with chronic conditions, and those requiring constant supervision. According to some estimates, spending on the Healthcare IoT solutions will reach a staggering $1 trillion by 2025 and, hopefully, will set the stage for highly personalized, accessible, and on-time Healthcare services for everyone. Networked sensors, either worn on the body or embedded in our living environments, make possible the gathering of rich information indicative of our physical and mental health. Captured on a continual basis, aggregated, and effectively mined, such information can bring about a positive transformative change in the health care landscape. The IoT is used by clinical care to monitor physiological statuses of patients through sensors by collecting and analyzing their information and then sending analyzed patient’s data remotely to processing centers to make suitable actions. Not only for patients, it also useful for normal people to check the health status by using wearable devices with sensors. This project concentrates to make a healthcare application of iot using DY-039, DB1820 sensors and a python script as the middle-ware
